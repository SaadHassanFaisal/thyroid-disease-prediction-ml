# 🩺 Predictive Modeling for Thyroid Disease Diagnosis  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project presents an AI-powered system for predicting thyroid disorders using advanced machine learning techniques.  
Through careful data preprocessing, feature selection, and ensemble modeling, we developed a robust diagnostic solution.  
The system is deployed as a Flask-based web application with ngrok for real-time accessibility, bridging the gap between research and practical healthcare support.  

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
• Cleaned and structured medical records for consistency  
• Addressed missing values and reduced noise  

2. **Feature Selection & Engineering**  
• Performed feature importance analysis  
• Retained only clinically significant attributes  

3. **Modeling**  
• Benchmarked Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  
• Designed an **ensemble model** that outperformed individual algorithms  

4. **Deployment**  
• Developed a Flask API for prediction services  
• Integrated with ngrok for live testing and external accessibility  

## 🎯 Key Features  
• End-to-end machine learning pipeline from raw data to deployment  
• Ensemble learning approach ensuring **reliable and balanced predictions**  
• Real-time web app for convenient thyroid disease risk assessment  
• Demonstrates the potential of AI in **data-driven healthcare decision support**  

## 📊 Performance  
• Ensemble model consistently delivered superior results compared to single models  
• Achieved higher accuracy and balanced evaluation across metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)  
• Robust predictions suitable for real-world healthcare use cases
